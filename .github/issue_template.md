- Please specify your mobile platform(s) and react-native & react-native-image-filter-kit versions. Also check https://github.com/iyegoroff/react-native-image-filter-kit#status if your rnifk version corresponds with your rn version.

- Sometimes cleaning the project could resolve build issues: press `Shift + Cmd + K` in Xcode and run `cd android && ./gradlew clean` in terminal.

- In case you use Expo you have to switch to 'bare workflow' in order to use this module.

- If your app crashed due to react-native-image-filter-kit, please attach a crash log or provide a minimal repro.
